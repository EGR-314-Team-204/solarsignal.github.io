## Design Ideation:

In our team, Jeremiah and Jacob laid the groundwork for ideas, while Gavin and Brennan integrated them into our collaborative Jamboard sessions. Our most effective brainstorming involves rapid idea-forming, building upon each other's contributions. Individual brainstorming was less successful. Our process for organizing and ranking ideas was guided by customer Voice of Customer (VOC) insights. Each team member sketched a design concept: Gavin - Design Concept 3, Jeremiah - Design Concept 2, and Brennan - Design Concept 1. This division of labor resulted in a diverse portfolio of concepts catering to various user preferences.

In the process of generating design ideas, our team adhered to a systematic approach for the effective generation and evaluation of ideas. We commenced the process by employing a digital collaborative tool named Jamboard. Below is a concise overview of the steps we undertook:

1.  Jamboard Creation: Our initial step involved the creation of a Jamboard, where team members collaboratively contributed ideas. Through extensive brainstorming sessions, we successfully generated a comprehensive list of 100 diverse concepts.
    
2.  Categorization: To enhance clarity and streamline our ideas, we opted for a different method. We categorized the designs into three distinct bins, each corresponding to a potential design direction. These bins were carefully defined to encapsulate the diverse aspects of User Interaction, Materials, Hardware and Software, Design, as well as Battery/Storage considerations.
    
3.  Concept Sketches: As the third step, we translated our categorized designs into reality by creating three concept sketches/designs using CAD software. This allowed us to obtain a preliminary visualization of how the three designs identified in the categorization stage would manifest in a tangible form.

Below, our team’s Jamboard without categorization can be seen below in Figure 1![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8n1vSbGROwkQY0_1YYfFdvfFjt00AKvtBIW-74R_YryzFv4x5cmUN-iY4ndcwKo6X9-0oBNkLWjlpfIUvPoXG4VXIMERf0YZhpASdsrl5grW6Zl4gJkEGkXfI4D_yeDA8Fr7aMgyhNzl0H5tlVLtLos)

### Concept Designs

Following the organization of our Jamboard into distinct "bins" representing potential designs, we took the initiative to bring them to life visually. Consequently, the team crafted three concept sketches, each corresponding to a specific design bin formulated during the Jamboard process.

<br>

<br>

<br>

### Design 1

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wIhI-Ran3O0zuBCtxJxnX2CHuYEwJ-sbWZ_HEht6_dvQ0C19erQfH3RY3nSiyiWRljzy7NT1WcYbzz36UW_cjGNBYL-kTJHu67yIBXfxyZddCrgGYJ7AFMOYIRFRJNKhKTYiMdIXhGdpWHdEzODAyW8)
Design 1 contains a standup approach consisting of various manual buttons and knobs, which will change the pitch of the attached solar panel. The use of flashing LEDs for alerts, a generous LCD screen, and a panel to hide electronics is used to successfully blend into a natural environment, while producing constant solar energy during the day.

<br>

<br>

<br>

### Design 2

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-74jjEOcOLqmYe8y_dumP0lPtiNK7MmT-U2rlOjLOb_CsrqvCz7Up5lWcngcvPhD5zkk69k9jDZgWyEAuTNPaMG4CUY-izKdjHGGQg-VM2iMagC3b6kNPHrZSxdLyZfB0qpG5wdfYjYkZR2_2KlCQvs)
Design 2 The concept behind design two is to have a fully sustainable garden weather station. We wanted to incorporate a design that could easily be added to an existing garden. On board are a few different features suitable for those who want a garden weather station, some of the sensors include temperature, light sensors, soil moisture monitoring and a motor to control the on board solar panels. Having the ability to control the position of the solar panel allows for a source of power. The readings of the on board sensors can be accessed and viewed via a wifi connection.
  
<br>

<br>

<br>

### Design 3

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pEFUsJ0AbboSfBUCbpcMpDnN1OQJOj7k1feLMLq20Ua1AwzVdHC-JXrPseLfMJKuflS8dPw-C7PleJSY61gGGCp6UPfz1yeiTkw5MkVEODGgcOKtdcRYeGDvDgtcZgk0iXxvhUCu4e3MiWD0usmrpYE)
Design 3 utilizes a bigger approach, but still blends into the environment by utilizing camouflaging colors. Additionally, the weather guarded solar panel on top is operated by OpenAi’s artificial intelligence, adjusting the pitch of the panel as well as sending alerts and advice. On the front of the device, one can connect to the source directly, as the device has on board power, but can also attach to external devices.





## Selected Design:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-74jjEOcOLqmYe8y_dumP0lPtiNK7MmT-U2rlOjLOb_CsrqvCz7Up5lWcngcvPhD5zkk69k9jDZgWyEAuTNPaMG4CUY-izKdjHGGQg-VM2iMagC3b6kNPHrZSxdLyZfB0qpG5wdfYjYkZR2_2KlCQvs)
After some deliberation we going with the second option. The concept behind design two is to have a fully sustainable garden weather station. We wanted to incorporate a design that could easily be added to an existing garden. On board are a few different features suitable for those who want a garden weather station, some of the sensors include temperature, light sensors, soil moisture monitoring and a motor to control the on board solar panels. Having the ability to control the position of the solar panel allows for a source of power. The readings of the on board sensors can be accessed and viewed via a wifi connection. Mechanically, we will have a watertight seal and the top solar panel section will rotate wusing onboard motor.

## Block Diagram:

![Block Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/NkegtMJ.png)
Each of us are responsible for our own subsystems to make this project come to life. We have a total of four subsystems. These include the micro controller, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and motor driver. In addition to this we have a solar panel that is not a dedicated subsystem but will be controlled by the motor driver in order to move. The micro controller is the brains of our design and will help us to control everything. The humidity and temperature sensors will gather their relevant data and feed it back to the end user. With all of these parts combined we aim to make a robust garden weather station that will be simple to use while providing valuable information for whoever uses it.

<br>

<br>

<br>

## Component Selection:

Component selection is an integral aspect of the engineering design process, as it significantly impacts future design and device development. As a team, we have developed a page dedicated to outlining the components selected for key subsystems, including power management and microcontroller integration, humidity and temperature sensing, and motor driver functionality. Below, you will find the chosen components, along with detailed explanations justifying their selection.

## [Temperature Sensor](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/TC74A4-3-3VCTTR/443268)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/2386/150%7EC04-091%7ECT%2C%20OT%7E5.JPG" width="400" height="400">

After researching various temperature sensors that we could use we decided on the TC74A4-3.3VCTTR from Microchip Technology. This is a simple temperature sensor that fits our project perfectly. 

 - It uses the I2C communication protocol to interface with out micro controller which is required for this project. 
 - Has low power consumption
 - Uses 3.3V, this helps our design as are aiming for a very low voltage design

There were a few other options for humidity sensors, but after looking around and weighing various options we decided on this humidity sensor due to its myriad of upsides.

<br>

<br>

## [Motor Controller](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/IFX9201SGAUMA1/5415542)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/376/P-PG-DSO-12.jpg" width="400" height="400">

We chose the Infineon Technologies IFX9201SGAUMA1 motor controller as it provides exactly the functionality needed for our design compared to other options. Additionally, we are familiar with the component, as we used it in our Advances Serial Communications assignment. Furthermore, we have example code that can be used to help us, as well as a working schematic.

- Built in H-Bridge allowing for easier control of our motor

- PWM interfaces
- It has a robust design that can handle harsh conditions
- The Advanced Serial Communications Assignment utilized this component, familiarizing us with it.



<br>

<br>

## [Battery](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-bsg/6LF22XWA-B/5067196)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/1302/MFG_6LF22XWA.jpg" width="400" height="400">

For a battery we opted for a simple household 9V battery and we will be using a switching power regulator in order to get the voltage down to 3.3V to power all of our components. Many of our parts are very low power and our max current going through the system is also low, so a simple battery seemed to the best option.

<br>

<br>

## [Switching Power Supply](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/LM2575D2T-3.3R4G/5801702?utm_adgroup=&utm_term=&utm_content=&gad_source=1)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/2468/D%C2%B2Pak%2CTO-263%3B%205%20Leads.jpg" width="400" height="400">

We are using a LM2575-3.3v this component is a simple switcher step-down voltage regulator. With this we will have a fixed output voltage of 3.3V. It can take voltages up to 40V with a 1A load.

<br>

<br>

## [Motor](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/ROB-10846/5318748)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/1164/MFG_ROB-10846.jpg" width="400" height="400">

We opted for the simple to use motor  ROB-10846 made by SparkFun Electronics. We wanted a robust motor that would also allow for easy control to help drive the movement of our solar panel. This motor is inexpensive but fits all of our design functions that we need.

<br>

<br>

## [Solar Panel](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/anysolar-ltd/SM111K10L/9990439)
<img src="https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/images/4431/MFG_SM111K10L.jpg" width="400" height="400">

Our onboard solar panel is configured in a diode ORing setup, enabling a split of the load between the 9V system and solar power. This design choice aligns with our commitment to the efficiency. The selected solar panel offers ample voltage for our circuit needs and the potential to support battery charging in future iterations. Most notably, the compactness of these solar cells is a key advantage, perfectly suiting the small form factor we are targeting. This configuration not only optimizes our energy management but also ensures our product remains portable.

<br>

### [Team BOM](/teamBOM.md)






## Software Proposal:

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/hbpWCdS.png)


This is our current version of our software proposal. We are trying to simplify our design as much as possible, as a whole it has only a few functions. It will be able to use the solar panel at the top of the device to help charge batteries and or power the system itself. As of right now we will be manually moving the solar panel with a predefined movement pattern that will go on throughout the day and it will reset back to the original position during the night. The on board humidity and temperature sensors will provide the key data our customers need in order to maintain their garden. We will have our sensors give the customer the data after a set amount of time has passed to keep things simple.
